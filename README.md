# Key things to consider while designing your 
# dashboard
 # 1. Color Selection
 Primary and/or secondary colors 
1. Choose from the corporate identity e.g., LOGO 
2. Choose from the industry. Example: For the metal industry choose grey and yellow 
#for beauty products choose purple/ red/ pink, for fashion brands dark blue or black, etc.
 3) Choose colors based on the theme of the dashboard or report
 Theme colors 
#Determine the colors for the various elements on the dashboard such as page 
background, container background, borders, primary texts, secondary texts, 
highlighting texts, etc. 
# 2. Font Selection
 Choose the fonts for the identity/industry/subject. 
##Size ##
#Determining the size for the KPI values, title text, value texts, and paragraph texts (in 
case of storytelling reports) in realtion to their importance and intended visibiltiy.

 # 3. Aspect Ratio
 Never go out of aspect ratios, it will make your static elements/ visuals ugly. 
1. Try to keep canvas size 16:9 ratio (popular ratios 1024×576, 1280×720, 1600×900, 
1920×1080, 2560×1440). In case of custom size keep width either 1024, 1280, 1600, 
1920, or 2560 and keep Height/ Length as required to accommodate all visuals
 2. Strictly keep Images & LOGOs in their aspect ratio
 3. Try to keep other elements’ size in multiple of 8 or if needed in a few cases in 
multiples of 4.
 # 4.  Positioning
 1. Try to place the elements at the positions (Horizontal / Vertical) in a multiple 
of 8 and f need than a multiple of 4
 2. Maintain proper distances (in most cases equal) from left and right to each 
other - not too congested or not too open
